 Git is a version control system a software that keeps tracks of our project we need to keep track of the project
 we post in case we make any changes such as 
 # 1.Adding a file,
# 2.Deleting a file
# 3. Adding a new line of code
 # 4.Checking what other developers have edited on a project
And so much more i wont explain much but now i believe you have a rough idea of wat am talking about 
 
 ## Here are some Benefit Of Version Control(Git)
 
 There are a number of benefits we get when we use a VCS such as Git to manage our work:

1.Automatically create a backup of our project.

2.Provide an easy way to undo mistakes and restore a previous version of the project.

3.Document changes with a log that describes what's been changed and why.

4.Easily view the differences between two versions of the project.

5.Branch work off into multiple "sandboxes" (called branches in Git) that allow developers to experiment without impacting other branches.

6.Collaborate with others without disturbing each other's or our own work.

And beyond these are even more advanced features that will help you optimize your workflow once you've learned the basics. If that feels daunting, it's OK: you will build up your toolbox of techniques over time. In the meantime, though, you can get the best benefits of Git using a relatively small subset of all the techniques and commands it includes.
